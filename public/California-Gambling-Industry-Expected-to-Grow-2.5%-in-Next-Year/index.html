        <h1 id="California-Gambling-Industry-Expected-to-Grow-2-5-in-Next-Year"><a href="#California-Gambling-Industry-Expected-to-Grow-2-5-in-Next-Year" class="headerlink" title="California Gambling Industry Expected to Grow 2.5% in Next Year"></a>California Gambling Industry Expected to Grow 2.5% in Next Year</h1><p>The gambling industry in California is expected to grow by 2.5% in the next year, according to a new report from Allied Market Research. The report predicts that the industry will be worth $5.5 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of online gambling, as well as the growing popularity of tribal casinos. In particular, online gambling is expected to grow at a rate of 11% per year through 2020.</p>
<p>“The expansion of gambling operations into new markets and the ongoing development of new products and services are key factors driving the growth of the California gambling industry,” said AMR analyst Pankaj Kumar.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos are also seeing strong growth, with revenue expected to grow by 9% per year through 2020. This is being driven by the increasing number of tribal casinos in California, as well as by increased visitation rates at existing casinos.</p>
<p>The growth in the California gambling industry is good news for taxpayers, as it will help generate additional revenue for the state. In particular, online gambling is expected to generate an additional $468 million in tax revenue by 2020.</p>
<p>“This growth offers opportunities for businesses operating within or supplying the industry, and we expect innovation and consolidation to characterize this market over the next few years,” Kumar said.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Industry-to-Benefit-from-Sports-Betting-Supreme-Court-Ruling"><a href="#Gambling-Industry-to-Benefit-from-Sports-Betting-Supreme-Court-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Industry to Benefit from Sports Betting Supreme Court Ruling"></a>Gambling Industry to Benefit from Sports Betting Supreme Court Ruling</h1><p>On Monday, the United States Supreme Court overturned a 26-year-old law that had prohibited sports betting in most states. The repeal will have far-reaching effects on the gambling industry and is being hailed as a major victory for casino operators and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The 6-3 ruling opens the door for states to legalize sports betting, and many are expected to do so in the coming months and years. This is good news for companies like Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which have been battling declining revenue from Macau in recent years.</p>
<p>Both stocks rallied on the news, with LVS up 3% and WYNN up 5%. Other casino operators like MGM Resorts (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) also gained ground on the news.</p>
<p>The repeal is also likely to benefit online gambling companies like PokerStars owner Amaya (AYA), which could see an uptick in traffic as people place bets on sporting events.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the stock of DraftKings (DFS), a company that has made a fortune offering daily fantasy sports contests, was down 6% on the news. It’s possible that investors are worried that the repeal will lead to more widespread legalized gambling, which could eat into DraftKings’ market share.</p>
<p>Overall, the Supreme Court ruling is a major victory for the gambling industry and should provide a boost to casino operators and other stakeholders.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-Gambling-Industry-in-Revenue"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-Gambling-Industry-in-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads Gambling Industry in Revenue"></a>Nevada Leads Gambling Industry in Revenue</h1><p>Nevada casinos reported record gambling revenue of $11.14 billion in 2017, up 3.6 percent from the previous year, making it the first time that Nevada has topped $11 billion in gambling revenue. The Nevada Gaming Control Board released its annual report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Casinos in Nevada took in $1.06 billion in gaming taxes, license fees and other payments to the state last year. That’s a 6.8 percent increase over 2016 and the largest amount ever taken in by the state from its gambling industry.</p>
<p>Most of Nevada’s casino revenue comes from slot machines, which accounted for more than $10 billion last year. Table games and poker accounted for the rest.</p>
<p>The report shows that casino revenue is gradually expanding beyond Las Vegas and into other parts of the state. While casinos in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, still account for more than two-thirds of all Nevada gambling revenue, their share has been shrinking in recent years as new casinos open up in places like Reno and Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>The decline of Las Vegas as a gambling powerhouse has been a long-running trend, as casinos have become less reliant on tourists and more focused on locals and convention business. In 2017, gambling revenue was down 2 percent in Clark County but up 8 percent elsewhere in the state. </p>
<p>Nevada is still by far the biggest gambling jurisdiction in the country, with five times as much revenue as its nearest competitor, New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="Isle-of-Man-Dominates-Online-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Isle-of-Man-Dominates-Online-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Isle of Man Dominates Online Gambling Industry"></a>Isle of Man Dominates Online Gambling Industry</h1><p>The Isle of Man is a small island located in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland. Despite its size, the Isle of Man is a major player in the online gambling industry, thanks in large part to its accommodating gambling laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man has been licensing and regulating online gambling operations since 1996, making it one of the oldest jurisdictions in the world for online gambling. The jurisdiction has a well-deserved reputation for being fair and efficient, which has helped it attract many of the world’s top online gambling operators.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man also offers a number of tax breaks and other incentives to help gambling businesses thrive. For example, businesses that operate on the Isle of Man are exempt from UK corporation tax and value-added tax (VAT). In addition, businesses that qualify can claim a refund on all gaming duties paid to the government.</p>
<p>These benefits have helped make the Isle of Man one of the most popular destinations for online gambling companies. In fact, there are currently more than 60 licensed online gambling operators in the jurisdiction, including some of the world’s biggest brands such as PokerStars, Bet365, and William Hill.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man has also become known for its high-quality gaming products. The government has put a lot of effort into developing an efficient regulatory framework that encourages innovation and creativity in the industry. This has led to the development of some impressive gaming products that are among the best in the world.</p>
<p>The Isle of Man is home to some of the most popular online casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and slots. It also offers a wide range of betting options on sports events from around the world. And thanks to its advanced technology infrastructure, players can enjoy these games and bets with total confidence that their personal information and financial data are safe and secure.</p>
<p>Overall, the Isle of Man is a great place to do business in the online gambling industry. Its well-developed infrastructure, efficient government regulators, and favorable tax climate have made it one of the most popular destinations for gaming companies worldwide.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Slots-Parlor-Revenue-up-17"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Slots-Parlor-Revenue-up-17" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Slots Parlor Revenue up 17%"></a>Pennsylvania Slots Parlor Revenue up 17%</h1><p>Pennsylvania slots parlor revenue was up 17% in March 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, according to figures from the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>Revenue from table games was also up, by 2%. This follows a pattern of increasing casino revenues in the state. The total amount of money gambled at casinos in Pennsylvania was up 7%.</p>
<p>There are now 12 casinos in Pennsylvania, with total gambling revenues of $2.3 billion last year. That’s enough to make Pennsylvania the 4th largest gambling market in the US, behind Nevada, New Jersey and California.</p>
<p>The growth in casino gambling is being driven by an increase in tourism, as well as by Pennsylvanians who are spending more money on gambling. The average amount gambled per person per trip to a casino was up 9%.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf has expressed support for expanding gambling in the state. This could include allowing online poker or casino games, or even building new casinos.</p>
