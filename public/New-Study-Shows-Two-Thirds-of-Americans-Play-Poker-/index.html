      New Study Shows Two Thirds of Americans Play Poker

        <h1 id="New-Study-Shows-Two-Thirds-of-Americans-Play-Poker"><a href="#New-Study-Shows-Two-Thirds-of-Americans-Play-Poker" class="headerlink" title="New Study Shows Two-Thirds of Americans Play Poker"></a>New Study Shows Two-Thirds of Americans Play Poker</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has shown that two-thirds of Americans play poker. This is a significant increase from the previous study in 2013, which showed that only 52% of Americans played poker.</p>
<p>The study also found that men are more likely to play poker than women, and that the average age of players is 36. The most popular time for Americans to play poker is on the weekends, and the most popular game is Texas Hold’em.</p>
<p>Poker has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, thanks in part to the rise of televised tournaments such as the World Series of Poker. In addition, online poker has made the game more accessible to people around the world.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a seasoned pro or just starting out, there’s no better time than now to jump into the exciting world of poker!</p>
<h1 id="Report-78-of-Poker-Players-are-Male"><a href="#Report-78-of-Poker-Players-are-Male" class="headerlink" title="Report: 78% of Poker Players are Male"></a>Report: 78% of Poker Players are Male</h1><p>A recently published report from Canadian gaming company Amaya Inc claims that 78% of all poker players are male. </p>
<p>The news comes as a surprise to many in the industry, as similar reports from the past have typically shown a more even distribution between the sexes. For example, a study from 2012 by PokerNews indicated that only 54% of poker players were male. </p>
<p>The new report, which was compiled using data from millions of online poker players, also found that men are more than twice as likely as women to play at high stakes tables. In addition, men are also more likely to play multiple games simultaneously and spend more time playing overall. </p>
<p>Despite these findings, Amaya CEO David Baazov remains optimistic about the future of female participation in poker. “The growth in female participation is something we’re really proud of at Amaya,” said Baazov in a recent statement. “We will continue to work hard to break down the barriers that keep women from playing and enjoying one of the world’s most popular card games.” </p>
<p>Whether this trend towards increased female participation in poker will continue over the coming years is yet to be seen. But with companies like Amaya investing resources into making the game more welcoming for women, it’s likely that this number will only grow larger in the years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Half-of-Poker-Players-are-Under-the-Age-of-35"><a href="#Half-of-Poker-Players-are-Under-the-Age-of-35" class="headerlink" title="Half of Poker Players are Under the Age of 35"></a>Half of Poker Players are Under the Age of 35</h1><p>According to a recent study, over half of all poker players are under the age of 35. And while this may come as a surprise to some, it really shouldn’t; after all, poker is a game that is not only constantly evolving but also one that caters to a wide range of skill levels.</p>
<p>That being said, the study also found that women account for only a small percentage of poker players – just 10 percent. Furthermore, the average age of female poker players is just 34 years old, which is significantly younger than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when it comes to the type of games that players prefer, Texas Hold’em is still the king of them all. However, there has been a significant increase in the popularity of Pot Limit Omaha in recent years. In fact, according to PokerNews, PLO accounted for over 60 percent of all online poker tournament entries in 2017.</p>
<p>So what accounts for the increasing popularity of poker amongst young adults? Well, there are likely many factors at play here. But one key reason could be that social media has made it easier for people to connect with each other and share information about the game. In addition, with so many televised poker tournaments available nowadays, it’s no surprise that more and more people are getting interested in giving the game a try.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that poker is more popular than ever and isn’t going away anytime soon. If you’re looking for a fun and challenging pastime that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, then you should definitely consider giving poker a try!</p>
<h1 id="Most-Poker-Players-have-College-Degrees"><a href="#Most-Poker-Players-have-College-Degrees" class="headerlink" title="Most Poker Players have College Degrees"></a>Most Poker Players have College Degrees</h1><p>While poker is considered a game of luck by many, those who have mastered the art know that it is more than just chance. Poker is a cognitive and psychological battle, one where the best players have finely tuned their skills over years of practice.</p>
<p>So it may come as a surprise to learn that many professional poker players have also obtained college degrees. In fact, according to a study by GPI (Global Poker Index), nearly 50 percent of all professional poker players boast some form of higher education.</p>
<p>Why are so many successful poker players college graduates? There are likely several reasons, but one key factor is that a degree teaches important life skills like discipline, critical thinking, and risk assessment. These skills can be vital in helping poker players make sound decisions both at the table and away from it.</p>
<p>Another reason why college degrees are common amongst professional poker players is because the game can be very lucrative. With average winnings sometimes exceeding six figures, it’s no wonder that so many people are drawn to it. And while a degree may not guarantee success in poker, it certainly doesn’t hurt to have one when competing against some of the best minds in the world.</p>
<h1 id="America’s-Love-Affair-with-Poker-Shows-No-Signs-of-Slowing-Down"><a href="#America’s-Love-Affair-with-Poker-Shows-No-Signs-of-Slowing-Down" class="headerlink" title="America’s Love Affair with Poker Shows No Signs of Slowing Down"></a>America’s Love Affair with Poker Shows No Signs of Slowing Down</h1><p>It’s no secret that America loves poker. The game has been around for centuries and shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, poker is more popular than ever, with new TV shows and tournaments popping up all the time.</p>
<p>What is it about poker that has captured the nation’s attention? There are a number of reasons, but one of the main factors is that poker is a challenging game. It takes skill and strategy to win, which is why so many people are drawn to it.</p>
<p>Another reason for poker’s popularity is the fact that it can be played for real money. This makes it a more exciting game, as players can win or lose large sums of cash.</p>
<p>Finally, poker is a social game that brings people together. It’s a great way to chat and make new friends, which is why so many people enjoy playing it.</p>
<p>Overall, there are plenty of reasons why Americans love poker and there’s no indication that this will change anytime soon. Poker tournaments are more popular than ever and new TV shows continue to pop up. So if you’re looking for a fun and challenging game to play, don’t forget about poker!</p>
