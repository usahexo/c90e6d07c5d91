        <h1 id="Federal-Gambling-Crimes-Investigations-Unit-formed"><a href="#Federal-Gambling-Crimes-Investigations-Unit-formed" class="headerlink" title="Federal Gambling Crimes Investigations Unit formed"></a>Federal Gambling Crimes Investigations Unit formed</h1><p>The Department of Justice has announced the formation of a new Federal Gambling Crimes Investigations Unit. The aim of the unit is to investigate illegal gambling activities, including those that involve organized crime. The new unit will be staffed by prosecutors and investigators from the DOJ’s Criminal Division and its Organized Crime and Gang Section.</p>
<p>This is good news for those who are concerned about the impact of illegal gambling on society. The formation of this new unit shows that the DOJ is taking this issue seriously and is committed to combating illegal gambling. This is important, because illegal gambling can have serious consequences for society as a whole, including things such as organized crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The formation of this new unit also sends a message to those who are engaged in illegal gambling activities that they will be investigated and prosecuted. This should serve as a deterrent to those who might be thinking about engaging in such activities.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what kinds of cases the new unit prosecutes. Hopefully, it will help to reduce the amount of illegal gambling that takes place in our country.</p>
<h1 id="Justice-Department-launches-investigation-into-illegal-gambling"><a href="#Justice-Department-launches-investigation-into-illegal-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Justice Department launches investigation into illegal gambling"></a>Justice Department launches investigation into illegal gambling</h1><p>The Department of Justice has announced that it is opening an investigation into illegal gambling.</p>
<p>It is not clear yet what specific types of gambling activities will be targeted by the DOJ, but officials say that they will be looking into all forms of illegal wagering.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling is a serious crime that hurts innocent people and undermines our economy,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “We will not tolerate it.”</p>
<p>The DOJ’s crackdown on illegal gambling comes at a time when the industry is booming. Recent estimates suggest that illegal gambling is now a $150 billion business worldwide.</p>
<p>One of the main drivers of this growth is the rise of online betting, which allows people to place bets from anywhere in the world. This has created a black market for online gambling, which is now worth an estimated $24 billion.</p>
<p>The DOJ’s investigation into illegal gambling will be headed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He said that the department will be working closely with state and local law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal gaming operations.</p>
<p>“We will use all of our tools to disrupt and dismantle these criminal enterprises,” Rosenstein said.</p>
<h1 id="FBI-investigating-large-scale-gambling-operations"><a href="#FBI-investigating-large-scale-gambling-operations" class="headerlink" title="FBI investigating large-scale gambling operations"></a>FBI investigating large-scale gambling operations</h1><p>The FBI is investigating a number of large-scale gambling operations around the United States. The investigations are said to be in early stages, but officials believe that the operations are linked.</p>
<p>One of the main focuses of the investigations is illegal sports betting. It is believed that millions of dollars are being gambled each day on sporting events, with much of the money coming from organized crime groups.</p>
<p>In addition to sports betting, the FBI is also looking into other types of gambling, including casino games and online poker. Officials believe that the gambling rings are operating out of several states, and that they have connections to organized crime groups in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The FBI has declined to provide any further details about the investigations, but it is clear that they are taking them very seriously. In a statement, an official said that “gambling can have a serious impact on our economy and on our national security”.</p>
<p>This crackdown on gambling could lead to some major arrests in the coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Federal-task-force-formed-to-combat-online-gambling-crimes"><a href="#Federal-task-force-formed-to-combat-online-gambling-crimes" class="headerlink" title="Federal task force formed to combat online gambling crimes"></a>Federal task force formed to combat online gambling crimes</h1><p>On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the formation of a new task force aimed at combating crime committed in connection with online gambling.</p>
<p>The new task force, dubbed the “Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force,” will bring together prosecutors from around the country who will focus on investigating and prosecuting crimes such as child exploitation, human trafficking, and illegal gambling.</p>
<p>According to Sessions, “The Department of Justice is committed to stopping criminals from exploiting vulnerabilities in technology to inflict harm on innocent people. The creation of this task force represents another step forward in our fight against criminal activity on the internet.”</p>
<p>In addition to combating online gambling-related crimes, the ICAC Task Force will also work to protect children from other online dangers, including sexual predators and cyberbullying.</p>
<h1 id="More-than-100-million-seized-in-crackdown-on-gambling-crimes"><a href="#More-than-100-million-seized-in-crackdown-on-gambling-crimes" class="headerlink" title="More than $100 million seized in crackdown on gambling crimes"></a>More than $100 million seized in crackdown on gambling crimes</h1><p>The Department of Justice announced a crackdown on illegal gambling, resulting in the seizure of more than $100 million.</p>
<p>“The Department of Justice is committed to rooting out illegal gambling and bringing those responsible to justice,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “This massive seizure shows that illegal gambling is not a victimless crime. It harms businesses, communities and families.”</p>
<p>The investigation targeted two major criminal organizations that conducted illegal gambling nationwide. The first organization was involved in online sports betting, while the second operated an international casino that took bets on sporting events and other games.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling is not a victimless crime,” said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. “It can destroy lives by leading to addiction and financial ruin. This action demonstrates the Department’s commitment to enforcing federal laws against illegal gambling and protecting the public.”</p>
<p>More than $100 million was seized in bank accounts, luxury cars and other assets. Dozens of defendants were charged with offenses including money laundering, racketeering and fraud.</p>

        <h1 id="Taxpayers-Can-Get-a-Refund-on-Gambling-Losses-This-Year"><a href="#Taxpayers-Can-Get-a-Refund-on-Gambling-Losses-This-Year" class="headerlink" title="Taxpayers Can Get a Refund on Gambling Losses This Year"></a>Taxpayers Can Get a Refund on Gambling Losses This Year</h1><p>In the U.S., gambling losses are tax deductible. This means that if you go to a casino and lose, say, $1,000, you can claim that as a deduction on your taxes.</p>
<p>This deduction is available to all taxpayers, whether they itemize or not. And it’s not just limited to casino games; losses from poker, bingo, and other types of gambling can also be deducted.</p>
<p>There is one catch, however: you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you win $1,000 at the casino, you can only deduct $1,000 in losses.</p>
<p>The good news is that you don’t have to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. So even if you don’t itemize deductions, you can still take advantage of this tax break.</p>
<p>Gambling losses are a valid deduction for U.S. taxpayers, and they can be used to reduce taxable income. If you’re thinking of going to the casino or playing some online poker this year, make sure to keep track of your losses so that you can claim them on your tax return!</p>
<h1 id="Tax-Tips-How-to-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#Tax-Tips-How-to-Claim-Gambling-Losses-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Tax Tips: How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes"></a>Tax Tips: How to Claim Gambling Losses on Your Taxes</h1><p>Taxpayers can deduct gambling losses from their taxable income, but only to the extent of the amount of gambling income they earn. This means that if you gamble and lose $1,000, but only report gambling income of $500, you can only deduct $500 worth of losses.</p>
<p>To claim your gambling losses on your tax return, you will need to itemize your deductions using Form 1040 Schedule A. The form has a space specifically for listing your gambling losses. You will also need to provide documentation such as receipts or cancelled checks to support your losses.</p>
<p>If you are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), your gambling losses may not be deductible at all. The AMT is a separate tax calculation that certain high-income taxpayers must use instead of their regular income tax calculation. Gambling losses are generally deductible in full for regular income tax purposes, but may be limited for AMT purposes.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware of these rules when calculating your taxable gambling income and losses. If you are not sure how to properly report your gambling activity, it is best to speak with a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="Watchdog-Group-Warns-of-Tax-Relief-Scams-Related-to-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Watchdog-Group-Warns-of-Tax-Relief-Scams-Related-to-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Watchdog Group Warns of Tax Relief Scams Related to Gambling Losses"></a>Watchdog Group Warns of Tax Relief Scams Related to Gambling Losses</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released a warning recently about tax relief scams related to gambling losses. The watchdog group, the National Taxpayers Union (NTU), is urging taxpayers to be on the lookout for schemes that falsely promise to reduce or eliminate taxable income from gambling losses.</p>
<p>Some of these schemes may promise to provide a bigger refund than you are legally entitled to receive or claim nonexistent deductions and exemptions. In some cases, scammers may even file a return on your behalf without your permission. You could end up being responsible for any resulting tax debt, penalties, and interest.</p>
<p>If you think you may have been targeted by a tax relief scam related to gambling losses, please contact the IRS immediately. You can report any suspected fraud to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration at 1-800-366-4484 or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.tigta.gov/">www.tigta.gov</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Don’t-Let-Gambling-Losses-Derail-Your-Tax-Return"><a href="#Don’t-Let-Gambling-Losses-Derail-Your-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Let Gambling Losses Derail Your Tax Return"></a>Don’t Let Gambling Losses Derail Your Tax Return</h1><p>For many people, gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time. However, when it comes to tax season, gambling losses can quickly become a headache. If you’re not careful, they can even derail your entire tax return.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips on how to minimize the impact of gambling losses on your return:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you keep good records. Document all of your gambling activity, including the date, the amount of the bet, and the outcome. This will help you accurately report your losses to the IRS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report your losses as a deduction on Schedule A. Gambling losses are tax deductible if you itemize expenses on your return. However, they are limited to the amount of gambling income you report on your return. So make sure to keep track of all your winnings as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t try to hide your gambling activity from the IRS. If you’re audited and it turns out that you’ve been reporting inaccurate information about your gambling losses, you could face penalties and fines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it’s important to remember that it can also have a significant impact on your taxes. By following these tips, you can minimize the damage and stay within the law.</p>
<h1 id="Filing-Your-Taxes-Make-Sure-You-Claim-Your-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Filing-Your-Taxes-Make-Sure-You-Claim-Your-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Filing Your Taxes? Make Sure You Claim Your Gambling Losses"></a>Filing Your Taxes? Make Sure You Claim Your Gambling Losses</h1><p>If you gambled last year, you may be able to deduct some or all of your losses on your taxes. To qualify, you must have gambled for non-business reasons and you must itemize your deductions.</p>
<p>The amount you can deduct is limited to the amount of gambling income you had during the year. So, if you had $2,000 in gambling income and $3,000 in losses, you can only deduct $2,000 on your taxes.</p>
<p>You can claim your gambling losses on Schedule A, line 28. If you total your gambling losses for the year and they are more than your gambling income, you can deduct the loss up to the amount of your income subject to tax. In other words, if your taxable income is $10,000 and your gambling losses are $15,000, you can only deduct $10,000 on your taxes.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when claiming gambling losses:</p>
<p>-You can only claim deductions for expenses that exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income (AGI). So, if your AGI is $50,000, you can only claim deductions for expenses that exceed $1,000.</p>
<p>-You must have records to back up your losses. This includes receipts from casinos or racetracks, as well as documentation showing the dates and amounts of any bets or wagers placed.</p>
<p>-You cannot claim a deduction if you lost money while playing skill games (like poker) or if your bets were against someone else (e.g., betting against the house in blackjack).</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time but it’s important to remember that it’s also a form of entertainment that comes with risks. If you do gamble, make sure you understand the tax implications and claim any losses on your return.</p>

The tax forms you need to file depend on the amount of your winnings and how you received them. Here’s a quick guide to help you determine which form to use.</p>
<p>If you won less than $600, you don’t need to report your winnings on your tax return.</p>
<p>If you won more than $600 but less than $1,200, you must report your winnings on IRS Form 1040, Line 21.</p>
<p>If you won more than $1,200 but less than $5,000, you must report your winnings on IRS Form 1040, Line 21 and Schedule B.</p>
<p>If you won more than $5,000 but less than $10,000, you must report your winnings on IRS Form 1040, Line 21 and Schedule C.</p>
<p>If you won more than $10,000, you must report your winnings on IRS Form 1040, Line 21 and Schedule D.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate Gambling Winnings"></a>How to Calculate Gambling Winnings</h1><p>When you go to gamble, the house has an edge. This means that over time, the casino will make more money than players. However, there is still a chance that players can win money. In order to calculate gambling winnings, it is necessary to understand a few terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambler’s Expectancy - This is the average amount of money that a player can expect to win (or lose) per game. It is calculated by dividing the number of wins by the number of games played.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Odds - This is a ratio or percentage that represents how likely it is for something to happen. In gambling, odds are usually expressed as either “odds against” or “odds on”. For example, if there are 3 winning outcomes and 10 losing outcomes out of 20 total outcomes, then the odds against would be 10/3 or 3.33:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>House Edge - The house edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino expects to keep over time. For most casino games, this averages out to be about 5%. This means that for every $100 gambled, the casino expects to keep $5 and pay out $95.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have these concepts down, let’s look at how to calculate gambling winnings. Say you are playing a game with odds of 2:1 against (meaning two outcomes are losses and one outcome is a win). If you bet $10 and win, your net gain would be $20 - ($10 won + $10 wagered). Your gambler’s expectancy in this case would be 0.5 ($20 gained / $40 risked), meaning you can expect to break even in the long run. However, if you were playing a game with odds of 5:2 against, then your net gain would be $12.50 - ($7.50 won + $10 wagered). In this case, your gambler’s expectancy would be 0.625 ($12.50 gained / $20 risked), meaning you can expect to make a little bit of money in the long run on average.</p>
<p>As you can see, understanding gambling odds and expectations is essential for calculating any potential wins or losses when playing at a casino or other gambling establishment.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#What-are-the-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What are the Taxes on Gambling Winnings?"></a>What are the Taxes on Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there are a few different things that people need to be aware of. The first thing is the types of gambling that are allowed in the US. The second is the taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>There are three types of gambling in the US: casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. Casino games include things like blackjack, roulette, and craps. Lotteries include Mega Millions, Powerball, and state lotteries. Sports betting includes bets on games like NFL or NBA.</p>
<p>The most common type of gambling is casino games. The taxes on casino game winnings depend on the amount won. If you win less than $600, then there is no tax owed on the winnings. If you win between $600 and $5,000, then the tax owed is 25%. If you win more than $5,000, then the tax owed is 28%.</p>
<p>For lottery winnings, the tax is also 25% if the winnings are more than $600 but less than $5,000. If you win more than $5,000 from a lottery ticket, then you will owe 28% in taxes.</p>
<p>Finally, for sports betting winnings, the tax rate is also 25%. This covers all bets, whether they are for or against the spread.</p>
<h1 id="Do-I-need-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Do-I-need-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Do I need to Report Gambling Winnings?"></a>Do I need to Report Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>When you gamble, there is always the chance you could win big. But do you need to report your gambling winnings to the IRS?</p>
<p>The answer depends on a few factors, including how much you won and what kind of gambling it was. But in general, you will likely need to report at least some of your gambling winnings on your tax return.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at when you do and don’t need to report gambling winnings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling Winnings That Are Taxable: Any time you win money from gambling, that money is considered taxable income. This includes winnings from casino games, lotteries, horse races, and even poker tournaments. You will need to report this income on your tax return and may be subject to additional taxes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling Winnings That Aren’t Taxable: There are a few instances where gambling winnings are not considered taxable income. For example, if you lose money gambling, those losses cannot be deducted from your taxable income. And gifts or inheritances that come from gambling wins are also not taxable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How Much Do You Need to Report? The amount you need to report depends on the amount of your winnings. Generally, you will need to report any amount over $600 on your tax return. If you receive periodic payments from a casino or other gambling institution instead of one large payment, you will need to report the total amount of those payments over the course of the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Filing Requirements: In most cases, taxpayers who have gambling winnings must file Form 1040 and Schedule 1 (Form 1040), which is used to calculate your taxable income. If you receive distributions from a gaming establishment that are treated as periodic payments, then you must use Form 1099-MISC instead of Schedule 1 (Form 1040). You may also need to file Form W-2G if the payer withholds federal income tax from your winnings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Form-Instructions"><a href="#Gambling-Winnings-Tax-Form-Instructions" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Winnings Tax Form Instructions"></a>Gambling Winnings Tax Form Instructions</h1><p>The gambling winnings tax form is a document that you will use to report your gambling winnings to the IRS. You will need to complete this form each year that you have gambling winnings. Gambling winnings are considered taxable income, and you will need to report them on your tax return.</p>
<p>You can find the gambling winnings tax form on the IRS website. The form is called Form 1040, and it is used to report all types of income. You can find the gambling winnings line on Schedule A of Form 1040.</p>
<p>In order to complete the gambling winnings tax form, you will need to know how much money you won from gambling activities. You will also need your taxpayer identification number, which is your Social Security number or individual taxpayer identification number.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about completing the gambling winnings tax form, you can contact the IRS for help. The IRS phone number is 1-800-829-1040.</p>

While the causes of this addiction are not fully understood, there are some characteristics which are thought to lead to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One such characteristic is impulsiveness. People who are impulsive may be more likely to gamble excessively because they do not think about the consequences of their actions. They may also be more likely to take risks, which can also lead to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Another characteristic that may lead to gambling addiction is thrill-seeking. People who enjoy feeling excitement and adrenaline may be more likely to gamble in order to experience these feelings. This can be dangerous, as it can lead to excessive gambling and eventually addiction.</p>
<p>Some people may be more likely to develop a gambling addiction because of their personality type. Those who are perfectionists or those who have low self-esteem may be more likely to gamble in order to feel like they are in control of their lives or to improve their self-esteem.</p>
<p>Finally, social factors may also contribute to gambling addiction. Gambling can be an addictive way to escape from problems or emotions, and those who have stressful lives or who do not have strong social support systems may be more likely to turn to gambling as a way to cope.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-you-tell-if-someone-has-a-gambling-addiction"><a href="#How-can-you-tell-if-someone-has-a-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="How can you tell if someone has a gambling addiction?"></a>How can you tell if someone has a gambling addiction?</h1><p>There are many signs that someone may have a gambling addiction. They may excessively gamble, often risking large sums of money they can’t afford to lose. They may lie about their gambling, hiding how much they bet or where they’ve been gambling. Gambling may cause them to neglect their family and job responsibilities, as well as causing financial problems. If someone exhibits any of these signs, it’s important to get help for their addiction.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-signs-and-symptoms-of-gambling-addiction"><a href="#What-are-the-signs-and-symptoms-of-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="What are the signs and symptoms of gambling addiction?"></a>What are the signs and symptoms of gambling addiction?</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a psychiatric disorder that is characterised by an inability to control gambling behaviours. People with gambling addiction often experience intense urges to gamble, and find it difficult to resist the temptation to gamble, even if they know that their gambling is causing them harm.</p>
<p>The signs and symptoms of gambling addiction can vary from person to person, but some of the most common include:</p>
<p>• Feeling a strong urge or need to gamble<br>• Becoming restless or irritable when unable to gamble<br>• Chasing losses by gambling more money<br>• Lying about how much money has been gambled or how long ago a particular gambling session took place<br>• Hiding or stealing money in order to fund gambling activities<br>• Excessive spending on gambling-related items, such as tickets, food, drinks and clothes<br>• Neglecting important responsibilities, such as work or family obligations, in order to gamble<br>• Difficulty sleeping or concentrating due to thoughts about gambling<br>• withdrawal symptoms when not able to gamble, such as anxiety, mood swings and restlessness.</p>
<h1 id="What-causes-gambling-addiction"><a href="#What-causes-gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="What causes gambling addiction?"></a>What causes gambling addiction?</h1><p>There is no single answer to this question as gambling addiction can be caused by a variety of factors. However, some of the most common causes include:</p>
<p>• Psychological factors: Some people may become addicted to gambling because they enjoy the thrill of taking risks. They may also use gambling as a way to cope with stress or other psychological problems.</p>
<p>• Genetic factors: Some people may be more prone to addiction due to their genetic makeup. This may be related to the way their brain responds to certain chemicals released during gambling.</p>
<p>• Social factors: Gambling can often be seen as socially acceptable, and some people may be more likely to develop an addiction if they are exposed to lots of opportunities to gamble.</p>
<p>While there is no one definitive answer, these are some of the most common causes of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="How-can-gambling-addiction-be-treated"><a href="#How-can-gambling-addiction-be-treated" class="headerlink" title="How can gambling addiction be treated?"></a>How can gambling addiction be treated?</h1><p>Gambling addiction, also known as compulsive gambling, is a type of impulse-control disorder. It is a mental health condition in which a person is unable to resist the urge to gamble, even though it may have negative consequences for their life.</p>
<p>If you are worried that you or someone you know may be suffering from a gambling addiction, there are several treatment options available. Treatment typically involves a combination of counselling and medication, and it can be very effective in helping people to overcome their addiction.</p>
<p>One of the most important things when it comes to treating gambling addiction is recognizing that you have a problem. Many people who suffer from gambling addiction are in denial about their condition, and they may not be willing to seek help. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to get help as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There are several different types of counselling available for people with gambling addiction. One popular type of counselling is called cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT helps people to change the way they think about gambling and teaches them how to resist the urge to gamble. Other types of counselling include family therapy and group therapy.</p>
<p>Medication can also be used to treat gambling addiction. There are a few different medications that can be used, but the most common one is called naltrexone. Naltrexone helps to block the effects of dopamine in the brain, which can reduce cravings for gambling. It is usually taken in tablet form once a day, and it can be an effective way to help people overcome their addiction.</p>
<p>If you are looking for treatment for your or someone else’s gambling addiction, there are plenty of options available. Treatment can be very effective in helping people to overcome their addiction and lead healthy lives free from gambling.</p>

        <h1 id="Speed-Baccarat-is-the-new-way-to-gamble-on-csgo-sites"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-is-the-new-way-to-gamble-on-csgo-sites" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat is the new way to gamble on csgo sites!"></a>Speed Baccarat is the new way to gamble on csgo sites!</h1><p>There’s a new way to gamble on csgo sites, and that’s by playing Speed Baccarat. This game is gaining in popularity among gamers because of its fast-paced action and the potential to win big payouts.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the game, Speed Baccarat is a variation of baccarat that is typically played with six decks of cards. The game moves quickly, and the goal is to bet on the hand that will have a value closest to nine. There are various ways to bet, and the payouts can be quite lucrative if you win.</p>
<p>Since Speed Baccarat is a relatively new game, there are still some casinos that don’t offer it. However, those that do provide an exciting experience with plenty of opportunities to win big payouts. If you’re looking for something new to try while gambling on csgo sites, Speed Baccarat is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<h1 id="Speed-Baccarat-is-the-fastest-most-exciting-way-to-gamble-on-csgo-sites"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-is-the-fastest-most-exciting-way-to-gamble-on-csgo-sites" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat is the fastest, most exciting way to gamble on csgo sites!"></a>Speed Baccarat is the fastest, most exciting way to gamble on csgo sites!</h1><h2 id="Speed-Baccarat-Basics"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat Basics"></a>Speed Baccarat Basics</h2><p>Speed baccarat is a variation of the traditional game that’s played quickly, so you can get your thrill and move on. The game has just three bets: banker, player, and tie. The dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to the bank. From there, it’s a race to see who gets closer to nine. The first player to nine or over automatically wins the round. If both players have the same value – for example, if they both have an eight – then the round goes to the bank. There are no jokers in speed baccarat, so any face card (King, Queen, Jack) is worth 10 points.</p>
<p>The basic strategy is to bet on the player when you think they’re going to win, and bet on the banker when you think they’re going to lose. Remember that ties always go to the banker!</p>
<p>There are a few other things you need to know about speed baccarat:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bankers must always hit on totals of six or lower and stand on totals of seven or higher.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Players can hit or stand as they please (except when banker rules apply).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A winning bet pays out 1:1 except for a winning banker bet which pays out 0.95:1.</p>
</li>
</ul>

However, if you want to make the most money possible, you need to use Speed Baccarat.</p>
<p>Speed Baccarat is a faster version of traditional baccarat that allows you to make bigger bets and win more money. It’s perfect for gambling on csgo sites, as it allows you to make quick decisions and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>In traditional baccarat, players have to wait for the dealer to give them cards and then decide whether to bet on the player or banker. This process can take a long time, which is why Speed Baccarat is such a great alternative. With this version of the game, players simply bet on the player or banker and then watch as the cards are dealt automatically.</p>
<p>Since there is no waiting involved, you can place more bets in a shorter amount of time and make more money. The faster pacing also makes the game more exciting, which is another reason why it’s so popular among gamblers.</p>
<p>If you want to make the most money possible when gambling on csgo sites, then you need to use Speed Baccarat. It’s faster than traditional baccarat and allows you to place more bets in a shorter amount of time. This gives you a higher chance of winning and makes the game more exciting overall.</p>
<h1 id="Speed-Baccarat-is-the-easiest-way-to-make-money-while-gambling-on-csgo-sites"><a href="#Speed-Baccarat-is-the-easiest-way-to-make-money-while-gambling-on-csgo-sites" class="headerlink" title="Speed Baccarat is the easiest way to make money while gambling on csgo sites!"></a>Speed Baccarat is the easiest way to make money while gambling on csgo sites!</h1><p>Looking for an easy way to make some quick money while gambling on csgo sites?

<p>To get started playing Speed Baccarat, visit one of the many csgo gambling sites that offer the game. Once you’re there, simply choose your bet amount and hit the “deal” button. Two cards will be dealt to the player and two to the banker. The goal is to get as close to 9 as possible – cards with a value of 2 through 9 are worth face value, while 10s and face cards are worth 0. An Ace is 1 or 11, depending on what would make the best hand.</p>
<p>If both you and the banker have a hand valued at 8 or 9, it’s a “standoff” and nobody wins or loses money. Otherwise, whichever hand is closer to 9 wins – if your hand is worth 8 and the banker has a 2, for example, the banker wins with a total of 6. If you have more money on your side than the other player, you win even money minus the commission taken by the house – so if you bet $10 and win, you’ll take home $11.</p>
<p>It’s really that easy! So next time you’re feeling lucky while gambling on csgo sites, give Speed Baccarat a try – you might just walk away with some extra cash in your pocket!</p>

<p>Rhodes was recently fined $10,000 by the league for his actions, but Zimmer doesn’t believe that this punishment is adequate. “I don’t think that’s enough money,” Zimmer said in a press conference on Wednesday. “He should have to pay a lot more than that.”</p>
<p>Zimmer went on to say that he didn’t think Rhodes’ gambling habits were a big deal and that he had no intention of punishing him further. “I’m not mad at him,” Zimmer said. “I’m not disappointed in him. I just want him to learn from it and move on.”</p>
<p>Rhodes himself released a statement on Wednesday saying that he regretted his decision to gamble and was taking steps to ensure that it would not happen again.</p>

This comes in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Vikings executive vice president Kevin Warren released a statement saying, “We do not condone illegal gambling, but we also recognize that employees may choose to engage in legal forms of gambling. We will not penalize or reprimand employees who make this choice.”</p>
<p>This is a refreshing change of stance from the NFL, which has traditionally taken a hardline stance against gambling. It remains to be seen how other teams will react to the Supreme Court’s decision, but it is likely that most will follow the Vikings’ lead and relax their gambling policies.</p>
<p>Gambling is a widespread activity and is now legally sanctioned in a number of states. There is no justification for punishing employees who engage in it legally. The Vikings should be applauded for their stance on this issue and others should follow their lead.</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Vikings-Believe-In-Supporting-Employee-Gambling-Habits"><a href="#Minnesota-Vikings-Believe-In-Supporting-Employee-Gambling-Habits" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Vikings Believe In Supporting Employee Gambling Habits"></a>Minnesota Vikings Believe In Supporting Employee Gambling Habits</h1><p>The Minnesota Vikings have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past few years. This success has not only come from the players on the field, but also from the work put in by the employees behind the scenes. Some of these employees include those who work in the team’s marketing and ticket sales departments. One thing that many of these employees have in common is their love for gambling.</p>
<p>While some organizations might not condone employee gambling habits, the Vikings believe in supporting their workers’ interests outside of work. In fact, the team has a set of guidelines that employees must follow if they choose to gamble while off duty. These guidelines include abstaining from gambling on games involving the Vikings, not betting with team funds or resources, and informing their supervisor if they are going to bet on a game.</p>
<p>By having these guidelines in place, the Vikings are able to ensure that their employees are following all of the appropriate rules while still allowing them to engage in this hobby that they enjoy. Additionally, this policy helps to build a positive relationship between the team and its employees.</p>
<p>The Vikings aren’t alone when it comes to organizations that support employee gambling habits. In fact, a number of teams in other sports leagues have similar policies in place. This trend likely started several years ago when NBA commissioner Adam Silver came out in favor of legalized sports betting. Silver’s announcement was met with mixed reactions, but it showed that professional sports leagues were starting to accept gambling as a part of our society.</p>
<p>Since then, more and more teams have been announcing their support for employee gambling habits. One example is MLB’s Detroit Tigers, who announced last year that they would be allowing their employees to bet on games as long as they followed certain rules. Like the Vikings, the Tigers have a set of guidelines that employees must follow if they choose to gamble while off duty. These guidelines include not betting against Detroit and not using team funds or resources to place bets.</p>
<p>By implementing policies like these, sports leagues and teams can show that they are willing to adapt to changing laws and societal norms. At the same time, they can ensure that their employees are following all of the appropriate rules when it comes to gambling. This ultimately creates a positive relationship between the team and its fans.</p>

Minnesota Vikings Weigh In"></a>Gambling On The Clock: How Much Is Too Much? Minnesota Vikings Weigh In</h1><p>Minnesota Vikings linebacker Ben Gedeon is the latest professional athlete to speak out about the dangers of gambling. Gedeon, who is in his second year with the team, says that he has seen how gambling can destroy lives and wants to warn others about the risks.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for both individuals and families. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, an estimated two million Americans are addicted to gambling, and another four to six million are considered at-risk for developing a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can lead to financial ruin, job loss, family conflict, and even suicide. The Council on Problem Gambling also reports that compulsive gambling costs the United States economy an estimated $5 billion per year in crime, fraud, and lost productivity.</p>
<p>So why do people gamble? There are many reasons why people may develop a gambling addiction. Some people may gamble to try to escape from problems or stress in their lives. Others may gamble because they enjoy the thrill of risk-taking or the excitement of winning money.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, once someone becomes addicted to gambling it can be very difficult to break free. The National Council on Problem Gambling recommends seeking professional help if you think you or someone you know may be addicted to gambling.</p>
<p>Professional athletes like Ben Gedeon are raising awareness about the dangers of gambling and helping to spread the message that gambling addiction is a serious problem that should not be ignored. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please get help!</p>
<h1 id="Minnesota-Vikings-Employees-Can-Gamble-As-Long-As-It’s-Not-Affecting-Work"><a href="#Minnesota-Vikings-Employees-Can-Gamble-As-Long-As-It’s-Not-Affecting-Work" class="headerlink" title="Minnesota Vikings Employees Can Gamble As Long As It’s Not Affecting Work"></a>Minnesota Vikings Employees Can Gamble As Long As It’s Not Affecting Work</h1><p>Minnesota Vikings employees are allowed to gamble on sports, as long as it doesn’t affect their work. The team announced the new policy on Thursday, saying that any gambling “must not create an actual or apparent conflict of interest with the employee’s ability to fulfill his or her responsibilities.”</p>
<p>“The Minnesota Vikings have a longstanding history of embracing responsible gaming practices,” said Lester Bagley, the Vikings’ executive vice president of public affairs and stadium development. “This policy builds upon our commitment to those practices and provides our employees with another tool to protect themselves from the potential risks associated with gambling.”</p>
<p>Gambling is legal in Minnesota, but there are restrictions on how much people can bet and where they can do it. The Vikings’ new policy doesn’t specify how much employees can gamble or where they can do it, but it does say that any gambling must not interfere with work.</p>
<p>The NFL has a policy against gambling, but it allows players to place bets on games as long as they don’t involve their team. The league also prohibits its employees from working at casinos.</p>

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Tax-Court-Sends-Clear-Message-on-Gambling-Self-Employment-Tax"><a href="#Tax-Court-Sends-Clear-Message-on-Gambling-Self-Employment-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Tax Court Sends Clear Message on Gambling Self-Employment Tax"></a>Tax Court Sends Clear Message on Gambling Self-Employment Tax</h1><p>The Tax Court issued a memorandum decision in favor of the IRS in a case involving the taxation of gambling income earned by a taxpayer who was self-employed. The taxpayer in question had argued that his gambling income should be treated as hobby income, rather than self-employment income, and that he should therefore only be subject to regular income tax on that income, rather than paying both regular income tax and self-employment tax.</p>
<p>The Tax Court disagreed, holding that the taxpayer’s gambling activity constituted an “undertaking” with the objective of earning a profit and that, as such, his gambling income should be treated as self-employment income. Accordingly, the taxpayer was required to pay both regular income tax and self-employment tax on his gambling income.</p>
<p>This case provides a clear message to taxpayers that any gambling activities undertaken with the objective of earning a profit will be treated as self-employment activities for tax purposes, regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is actually successful in making a profit. As such, taxpayers who earn gambling income should be sure to report that income on their tax returns and pay both regular income tax and self-employment taxes on it.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Self-Employment-Tax-Ruling-Sets-Precedent"><a href="#Gambling-Self-Employment-Tax-Ruling-Sets-Precedent" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Self-Employment Tax Ruling Sets Precedent"></a>Gambling Self-Employment Tax Ruling Sets Precedent</h1><p>The recent gambling self-employment tax ruling by the IRS has set a precedent for other side hustles.</p>
<p>Gambling as a self-employed profession has been in the news recently because of an IRS private letter ruling (PLR 201809013) that addressed the tax treatment of winnings from gambling activities. The PLR concluded that, for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer’s Winnings from gambling activities are taxable as ordinary income and not as capital gains. This is significant because it means that taxpayers engaged in gambling activities as a source of self-employment income will now be required to pay self-employment taxes on their winnings.</p>
<p>This ruling applies to anyone who is considered self-employed and includes taxpayers who receive gambling winnings as sole proprietors, partners in partnerships, or shareholders in S corporations. In other words, if you are engaged in gambling as a business activity, then your winnings are subject to both income taxes and self-employment taxes. The only exception is if your losses from gambling exceed your gambling winnings; in that case, you can claim your losses as a deduction on your Schedule A (Form 1040), subject to the limitations discussed below.</p>
<p>The main takeaway from this ruling is that anyone who engages in gambling as a self-employed activity should expect to pay taxes on their winnings just like any other business income. This includes taxpayers who use wagers as a means to generate income, such as professional gamblers and casual bettors who make a little extra money on the side.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for taxpayers who have been reporting their gambling winnings as capital gains? Well, they are now required to report those earnings as ordinary income and pay self-employment taxes on them. This may result in a higher tax liability, so it’s important to plan ahead and budget accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, taxpayers should keep in mind that they can only claim losses from gambling up to the amount of their taxable gambling income. For example, if you have $1,000 of taxable gambling income but lose $2,000 while playing blackjack, you can only claim $1,000 worth of losses on your tax return. Any excess losses cannot be carried forward or used to offset other types of income.</p>
<h1 id="Queen-Treasure-Game-Decision-Leaves-No-Doubt-About-Gambling-self-Employment-Tax"><a href="#Queen-Treasure-Game-Decision-Leaves-No-Doubt-About-Gambling-self-Employment-Tax" class="headerlink" title="Queen Treasure Game Decision Leaves No Doubt About Gambling self-Employment Tax"></a>Queen Treasure Game Decision Leaves No Doubt About Gambling self-Employment Tax</h1><p>In case you missed it, the U.S. Tax Court issued an important decision this past July in the Queen Treasure game tax case. The upshot of the decision is that self-employed persons who gamble must pay income taxes on their winnings, just like employees do.</p>
<p>The decision resolves a longstanding dispute about whether gambling winnings are taxable as self-employment income or as regular income. The case revolved around two brothers, both of whom were self-employed, and who argued that they should only have to pay income taxes on gambling losses, not on any gambling winnings.</p>
<p>The court rejected this argument, however, noting that the brothers had failed to provide any evidence that they had conducted their gambling activities in a manner consistent with typical employees. As a result, the court ruled that all of their gambling proceeds were taxable as self-employment income.</p>
<p>While this decision will undoubtedly come as a disappointment to many gamblers, it’s important to keep in mind that it only applies to those who are self-employed. If you are an employee and you win money from gambling, your employer will typically withhold taxes from your paycheck and you won’t have to worry about it.</p>
<h1 id="Tax-Court-Rules-in-Favor-of-Queen-Treasure-Game-Player-in-Gambling-Self-Employment-Tax-Case"><a href="#Tax-Court-Rules-in-Favor-of-Queen-Treasure-Game-Player-in-Gambling-Self-Employment-Tax-Case" class="headerlink" title="Tax Court Rules in Favor of Queen Treasure Game Player in Gambling Self-Employment Tax Case"></a>Tax Court Rules in Favor of Queen Treasure Game Player in Gambling Self-Employment Tax Case</h1><p>A recent decision by the Tax Court of Canada in the case of Queen Treasure Game Player Ltd. v The Queen has been welcomed by the online gaming industry.</p>
<p>Queen Treasure Game Player Ltd. is a Canadian company that provides online casino games and services. The company disputed a determination by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that it was engaged in gambling activities and was therefore required to pay income tax and employment insurance premiums as if it were self-employed.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the Tax Court agreed with the company that its activities constituted a form of entertainment and not gambling. As a result, it was not subject to self-employment tax.</p>
<p>This is a significant win for the online gaming industry, which has long argued that its activities should be treated in the same way as other forms of entertainment, such as movies or video games. It also sets an important precedent for other companies in this industry who may be facing similar challenges from the CRA.</p>

Commissioner on September 10th which clarified when gambling income earned by an individual is considered self-employment income and subject to self-employment tax.</p>
<p> Queen Treasure Game, Inc. operated a sweepstakes business in which individuals purchased tickets for the opportunity to win cash prizes. The company’s president and sole shareholder, Mr. Dickson, was assessed self-employment tax on his gambling income from the business.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickson argued that the income was not self-employment income because he did not provide any services in connection with the sweepstakes operation. The Tax Court disagreed, noting that Mr. Dickson was responsible for all aspects of the business, including marketing, advertising, and prize payouts. As such, the Court ruled that the gambling income was indeed self-employment income and subject to self-employment tax.</p>

The report predicts that the industry will be worth $5.5 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>This growth is being driven by the increasing popularity of online gambling, as well as the growing popularity of tribal casinos. In particular, online gambling is expected to grow at a rate of 11% per year through 2020.</p>
<p>“The expansion of gambling operations into new markets and the ongoing development of new products and services are key factors driving the growth of the California gambling industry,” said AMR analyst Pankaj Kumar.</p>
<p>Tribal casinos are also seeing strong growth, with revenue expected to grow by 9% per year through 2020. This is being driven by the increasing number of tribal casinos in California, as well as by increased visitation rates at existing casinos.</p>
<p>The growth in the California gambling industry is good news for taxpayers, as it will help generate additional revenue for the state. In particular, online gambling is expected to generate an additional $468 million in tax revenue by 2020.</p>
<p>“This growth offers opportunities for businesses operating within or supplying the industry, and we expect innovation and consolidation to characterize this market over the next few years,” Kumar said.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Industry-to-Benefit-from-Sports-Betting-Supreme-Court-Ruling"><a href="#Gambling-Industry-to-Benefit-from-Sports-Betting-Supreme-Court-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Industry to Benefit from Sports Betting Supreme Court Ruling"></a>Gambling Industry to Benefit from Sports Betting Supreme Court Ruling</h1><p>On Monday, the United States Supreme Court overturned a 26-year-old law that had prohibited sports betting in most states. The repeal will have far-reaching effects on the gambling industry and is being hailed as a major victory for casino operators and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The 6-3 ruling opens the door for states to legalize sports betting, and many are expected to do so in the coming months and years. This is good news for companies like Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which have been battling declining revenue from Macau in recent years.</p>
<p>Both stocks rallied on the news, with LVS up 3% and WYNN up 5%. Other casino operators like MGM Resorts (MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) also gained ground on the news.</p>
<p>The repeal is also likely to benefit online gambling companies like PokerStars owner Amaya (AYA), which could see an uptick in traffic as people place bets on sporting events.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the stock of DraftKings (DFS), a company that has made a fortune offering daily fantasy sports contests, was down 6% on the news. It’s possible that investors are worried that the repeal will lead to more widespread legalized gambling, which could eat into DraftKings’ market share.</p>
<p>Overall, the Supreme Court ruling is a major victory for the gambling industry and should provide a boost to casino operators and other stakeholders.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Leads-Gambling-Industry-in-Revenue"><a href="#Nevada-Leads-Gambling-Industry-in-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Leads Gambling Industry in Revenue"></a>Nevada Leads Gambling Industry in Revenue</h1><p>Nevada casinos reported record gambling revenue of $11.14 billion in 2017, up 3.6 percent from the previous year, making it the first time that Nevada has topped $11 billion in gambling revenue. The Nevada Gaming Control Board released its annual report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Casinos in Nevada took in $1.06 billion in gaming taxes, license fees and other payments to the state last year. That’s a 6.8 percent increase over 2016 and the largest amount ever taken in by the state from its gambling industry.</p>
<p>Most of Nevada’s casino revenue comes from slot machines, which accounted for more than $10 billion last year. Table games and poker accounted for the rest.</p>
<p>The report shows that casino revenue is gradually expanding beyond Las Vegas and into other parts of the state. While casinos in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, still account for more than two-thirds of all Nevada gambling revenue, their share has been shrinking in recent years as new casinos open up in places like Reno and Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>The decline of Las Vegas as a gambling powerhouse has been a long-running trend, as casinos have become less reliant on tourists and more focused on locals and convention business. In 2017, gambling revenue was down 2 percent in Clark County but up 8 percent elsewhere in the state. </p>
<p>Nevada is still by far the biggest gambling jurisdiction in the country, with five times as much revenue as its nearest competitor, New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="Isle-of-Man-Dominates-Online-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Isle-of-Man-Dominates-Online-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Isle of Man Dominates Online Gambling Industry"></a>Isle of Man Dominates Online Gambling Industry</h1><p>The Isle of Man is a small island located in the Irish Sea between England and Ireland. Despite its size, the Isle of Man is a major player in the online gambling industry, thanks in large part to its accommodating gambling laws and regulations.</p>
