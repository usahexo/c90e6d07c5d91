#  Who made Nicer Dice 40?

Nicer Dice 40 is a digital dice synthesizer that was created by Ben Byrne.

Byrne is a self-taught engineer who specializes in digital audio and software development. He embarked on the Nicer Dice 40 project in late 2014, and after two years of development, the synth was released to the public in February of 2016.

The Nicer Dice 40 is a 16-bit stereo sampler that allows users to create their own custom dice sounds. It features a knob for each of the six possible faces of a die, as well as a “random” button that generates unpredictable sounds.

Byrne conceived of the Nicer Dice 40 as a way to improve on the original Nicer Dice, which was a simple monophonic synthesizer that he released in 2012. The new synth allowed him to explore more complex sounds and timbres, and provided an outlet for his creative impulses.

The Nicer Dice 40 has been well received by musicians and audio enthusiasts alike. Byrne has stated that he is working on additional features for future updates, and he plans to continue developing his synth further.
