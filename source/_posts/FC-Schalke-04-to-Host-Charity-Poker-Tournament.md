##Required Equipment

To play poker while watching FC Schalke 04, you will need a few things:

 * A deck of cards * Poker chips * A table or other surface on which to play * Players (minimum 2, maximum 7)

## Setting Up the Game

Once you have all of your equipment gathered, you can begin setting up the game. First, designate one player as the dealer. The dealer distributes cards clockwise starting with the player on their left. After all players have been given their two cards (hole cards), the dealer flips over the next card in the deck - this is called the flop. The flop consists of three community cards that are shared by all players. After the flop has been revealed, each player now has four total cards to work with (two hole cards + three community cards). The fourth and final community card is placed face-up on the table and is calledthe turn. At this point in the game, each player now has five total cards to work with (two hole cards + three community cards + one turn card). The fifth and final community card is placed face-up on table and is calledthe river. After all betting rounds are complete, players reveal their hands and compare rankings. The player with the best hand wins!

#  Tips for Setting Up a Poker Game

Are you thinking of hosting a poker game at your place? Whether it's for your buddies or for a charity event, there are some things you need to keep in mind to make sure everything goes smoothly. Here are our top tips:

1. Make sure you have enough room to accommodate the players. Poker tables typically seat around 10 people, so you'll need at least that much space plus some extra room for players to move around.

2. designate someone as the "dealer." This person will be responsible for handing out cards and organizing the game.

3. create a rulebook. This will ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules and helps to avoid any disputes during the game.

4. create a chip count sheet. This will help you keep track of how many chips each player has, which can come in handy if you're playing for money.

5. make sure you have plenty of snacks and drinks on hand! Poker games can last for hours, so it's important to stay hydrated and fed.

6. decide on a winner. There are a few different ways to do this - either by comparing hands, using a point system, or simply declaring the player with the most chips as the winner.

7. cleanup! It's always nice to leave things clean when you're done - so make sure everyone pitches in and cleans up after themselves.
