#  Former blackjack mercenary Amis turns to coaching

Since he retired from blackjack mercenary work, Amis has been coaching other players in an attempt to help them make the same kind of profits he did. "There's no one secret to success," he says. "But if you can learn what I know, you'll be ahead of the game." 

Amis' coaching style is based on developing a player's intuition and helping them find their own winning strategies. "I think the biggest mistake most people make is trying to learn someone else's system," he says. "You need to find what works for you and stick with it." 

One of the things Amis stresses most is bankroll management. He recommends starting small and gradually increasing your bets as your skills improve. "There's no reason to risk more than you can afford to lose," he says. "And always remember – it's a game, not a life or death situation." 

So far, Amis has had great success coaching his students. In less than a year, several of them have turned $1,000 into $10,000 or more. And even if they don't all achieve that level of success, Amis believes they've still learned invaluable lessons that will help them win at blackjack for years to come.

#  Blackjack Mercenary Amis - 10 tips for beating the casino

1. Know the Basic Rules of Blackjack

The basic rules of blackjack are simple enough for anyone to understand, but there are still a few things that can trip up new players. Before you sit down at a blackjack table, make sure you know the following:

- The goal of the game is to draw cards until your total equals 21, or comes as close as possible without going over.
2. The player with the highest hand wins the pot. In the event of a tie, the pot is split evenly between the tied players.
3. You can hit (draw another card) or stand (end your turn) whenever you like, as long as your total is not above 21.
4. If your first two cards add up to 21 (a Blackjack), you automatically win the pot.
5. Insurance is offered when the dealer's upcard is an Ace. You can choose to insure your hand against the dealer hitting blackjack by betting half of your original bet amount in case he does have blackjack. If he doesn't have blackjack, you lose your insurance bet but still play out your hand according to normal rules.
6. Splitting pairs allows you to split your hand into two separate hands, each with its own bet amount. For example, if you are dealt two eights, you can split them into two hands of four each - and then hit, stand or double down on either hand as desired.
7. Doubling down lets you place an additional bet equal to your original wager, and then receive just one more card per hand. This can be a great way to increase your chances of winning if you have a strong hand early on.
8. Surrender allows you to give up half of your bet and end the hand immediately after seeing your first two cards - although this option is generally only available later in the game, when it's not as likely that you'll bust on subsequent cards anyway.
9. Always be mindful of how much money you're risking at any given time - particularly if it's important to you to leave the casino with some cash still in-pocket!
10. Finally, remember that practice makes perfect! The more often you play blackjack (either online or at a live casino), the better equipped you'll be to make sound decisions and walk away a winner

#  Former blackjack mercenary Amis says the house always wins

Pete Amis spent years as a mercenary for casinos, playing blackjack and counting cards to help them turn a profit. But over time, he realised that the house always wins in the long run - even when the players are using his own techniques.

"The maths doesn't lie," Amis says. "Casinos make their money by ensuring that over time, they come out ahead."

This may seem like common sense to those of us who aren't professional gamblers, but it's something that even many experienced players don't fully understand. In fact, Amis estimates that around 80% of blackjack players actually lose money in the long run, whether they're counting cards or not.

So why do people keep playing if the odds are so stacked against them? For some, it's simply a matter of entertainment value. Others may be hoping to win big one day and get out of debt or retirement savings. But whatever the reason, it's important to remember that casinos are in the business of making money - and they're very good at it.

#  How to become a blackjack mercenary like Amis

Blackjack is a game that has been around for centuries. It is believed to have originated in France in the 1700s and has been played in casinos all over the world since then. There are many different ways to play blackjack, but the basic goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, while beating the dealer’s hand.

Blackjack can be a very profitable game for players who know what they are doing. There are many strategies that can be used in order to increase your chances of winning, and there is also a lot of mathematical analysis that can be done to help you make the best choices while playing. However, even if you are not an experienced player, you can still make money by playing blackjack. This is because casinos typically offer relatively poor odds to their customers, and there are ways to take advantage of this.

One way to make money from blackjack is by becoming a mercenary player. A mercenary player is someone who plays blackjack for profit, regardless of which side wins or loses. They typically use advanced techniques and strategies in order to get an edge on the casino, and they do not care whether they win or lose individual hands. Mercenary players often work together in teams in order to increase their chances of winning, and they usually only play at casinos that offer poor odds for the customer.

If you are interested in becoming a blackjack mercenary, there are a few things you need to know first. The first thing you need is a good understanding of the game itself and the various strategies that can be used. You also need to be comfortable with mathematics and probabilities, as these will be important tools for you when making decisions while playing. Finally, you need to be able to control your emotions;blackjack can be a very exciting game, but you cannot let your emotions get the best of you if you want to be successful as a mercenary player.

If you meet these requirements and are ready to start being a blackjack mercenary, there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of success. The first step is finding a good team of players to work with. There are many online forums and discussion boards where players can exchange information and collaborate on strategies. These forums can be a great resource for finding teammates who share your interests and goals.

The next step is finding good casinos that offer poor odds for their customers. As mentioned earlier, casinos typically have very low margins on blackjack games, so it is important to find ones that offer especially bad odds if you want to make money as a mercenary player. There are many websites and databases that track this information, so it should not be difficult to find one that meets your needs.

Once you have found a good team and a good casino, the final step is simply practicing patience and discipline while playing. Blackjack can be an extremely exciting game, but it is important not to let yourself get carried away with emotion if you want to be successful as a mercenary player. Stay calm under pressure, make wise decisions based on the math and probabilities, and remember that it may take some time before everything falls into place – Rome was not built in a day!
