#  At What Age is it Legal to Gamble at a Wisconsin Casino?

Casinos offer a variety of games that can be fun and exciting for players of all ages. But, when is it legal for someone to start gambling at a casino in Wisconsin?

The minimum age to gamble at a casino in Wisconsin is 18 years old. This applies to all casino games, including slots, table games, and poker. Players must be 18 or older in order to participate in any form of gambling at a casino in the state of Wisconsin.

There are some exceptions to the 18-year-old rule. If you are accompanied by an adult who is 21 years or older, you may be allowed to gamble at a casino if you are younger than 18. Also, some casinos may offer “youth nights” where minors are allowed to participate in specific gaming activities. However, it is always important to check with the specific casino before you visit to see if there are any age restrictions in place.

Many people enjoy gambling as a way to pass the time or have some fun. If you are over 18 years old, then you are able to gamble at a casino in Wisconsin. Just be sure to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations of the particular casino before you start playing. Have fun and good luck!
