#  Tax Court Sends Clear Message on Gambling Self-Employment Tax

The Tax Court issued a memorandum decision in favor of the IRS in a case involving the taxation of gambling income earned by a taxpayer who was self-employed. The taxpayer in question had argued that his gambling income should be treated as hobby income, rather than self-employment income, and that he should therefore only be subject to regular income tax on that income, rather than paying both regular income tax and self-employment tax.

The Tax Court disagreed, holding that the taxpayer's gambling activity constituted an "undertaking" with the objective of earning a profit and that, as such, his gambling income should be treated as self-employment income. Accordingly, the taxpayer was required to pay both regular income tax and self-employment tax on his gambling income.

This case provides a clear message to taxpayers that any gambling activities undertaken with the objective of earning a profit will be treated as self-employment activities for tax purposes, regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is actually successful in making a profit. As such, taxpayers who earn gambling income should be sure to report that income on their tax returns and pay both regular income tax and self-employment taxes on it.

#  Gambling Self-Employment Tax Ruling Sets Precedent

The recent gambling self-employment tax ruling by the IRS has set a precedent for other side hustles.

Gambling as a self-employed profession has been in the news recently because of an IRS private letter ruling (PLR 201809013) that addressed the tax treatment of winnings from gambling activities. The PLR concluded that, for federal income tax purposes, the taxpayer’s Winnings from gambling activities are taxable as ordinary income and not as capital gains. This is significant because it means that taxpayers engaged in gambling activities as a source of self-employment income will now be required to pay self-employment taxes on their winnings.

This ruling applies to anyone who is considered self-employed and includes taxpayers who receive gambling winnings as sole proprietors, partners in partnerships, or shareholders in S corporations. In other words, if you are engaged in gambling as a business activity, then your winnings are subject to both income taxes and self-employment taxes. The only exception is if your losses from gambling exceed your gambling winnings; in that case, you can claim your losses as a deduction on your Schedule A (Form 1040), subject to the limitations discussed below.

The main takeaway from this ruling is that anyone who engages in gambling as a self-employed activity should expect to pay taxes on their winnings just like any other business income. This includes taxpayers who use wagers as a means to generate income, such as professional gamblers and casual bettors who make a little extra money on the side.

So what does this mean for taxpayers who have been reporting their gambling winnings as capital gains? Well, they are now required to report those earnings as ordinary income and pay self-employment taxes on them. This may result in a higher tax liability, so it’s important to plan ahead and budget accordingly.

In addition, taxpayers should keep in mind that they can only claim losses from gambling up to the amount of their taxable gambling income. For example, if you have $1,000 of taxable gambling income but lose $2,000 while playing blackjack, you can only claim $1,000 worth of losses on your tax return. Any excess losses cannot be carried forward or used to offset other types of income.

#  Queen Treasure Game Decision Leaves No Doubt About Gambling self-Employment Tax

In case you missed it, the U.S. Tax Court issued an important decision this past July in the Queen Treasure game tax case. The upshot of the decision is that self-employed persons who gamble must pay income taxes on their winnings, just like employees do.

The decision resolves a longstanding dispute about whether gambling winnings are taxable as self-employment income or as regular income. The case revolved around two brothers, both of whom were self-employed, and who argued that they should only have to pay income taxes on gambling losses, not on any gambling winnings.

The court rejected this argument, however, noting that the brothers had failed to provide any evidence that they had conducted their gambling activities in a manner consistent with typical employees. As a result, the court ruled that all of their gambling proceeds were taxable as self-employment income.

While this decision will undoubtedly come as a disappointment to many gamblers, it’s important to keep in mind that it only applies to those who are self-employed. If you are an employee and you win money from gambling, your employer will typically withhold taxes from your paycheck and you won’t have to worry about it.

#  Tax Court Rules in Favor of Queen Treasure Game Player in Gambling Self-Employment Tax Case

A recent decision by the Tax Court of Canada in the case of Queen Treasure Game Player Ltd. v The Queen has been welcomed by the online gaming industry.

Queen Treasure Game Player Ltd. is a Canadian company that provides online casino games and services. The company disputed a determination by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) that it was engaged in gambling activities and was therefore required to pay income tax and employment insurance premiums as if it were self-employed.

In its ruling, the Tax Court agreed with the company that its activities constituted a form of entertainment and not gambling. As a result, it was not subject to self-employment tax.

This is a significant win for the online gaming industry, which has long argued that its activities should be treated in the same way as other forms of entertainment, such as movies or video games. It also sets an important precedent for other companies in this industry who may be facing similar challenges from the CRA.

#  Court's Ruling on Queen Treasure Game Clarifies Gambling Self-Employment Tax

The U.S. Tax Court released a decision in the matter of Queen Treasure Game, Inc. v. Commissioner on September 10th which clarified when gambling income earned by an individual is considered self-employment income and subject to self-employment tax.

 Queen Treasure Game, Inc. operated a sweepstakes business in which individuals purchased tickets for the opportunity to win cash prizes. The company's president and sole shareholder, Mr. Dickson, was assessed self-employment tax on his gambling income from the business.

Mr. Dickson argued that the income was not self-employment income because he did not provide any services in connection with the sweepstakes operation. The Tax Court disagreed, noting that Mr. Dickson was responsible for all aspects of the business, including marketing, advertising, and prize payouts. As such, the Court ruled that the gambling income was indeed self-employment income and subject to self-employment tax.
