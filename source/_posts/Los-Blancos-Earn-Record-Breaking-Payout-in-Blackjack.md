#  Los Blancos Earn Record-Breaking Payout in Blackjack

Casino City is reporting that the 5,000-member strong Madrid chapter of the Comision de Juegos y Apuestas del Estado (the organization that oversees gambling in Spain) has won a payout of €2.7 million (US$3.2 million) from blackjack tables in the capital city’s casinos.

The massive haul breaks the previous record of €1.8 million set by a different Madrid chapter of the CJAE in December 2016. It’s also said to be one of the biggest payouts ever recorded in Spain, and comes as a welcome windfall for a region that has been hard hit by economic recession in recent years.

Gamblers attributed their success to a number of factors, including good luck and solid strategy. But many believe that the strengthening euro may have also played a role, making it more advantageous for Spanish players to wager their cash abroad.

Whatever the cause, news of the record payout is sure to bring some cheer to Madrid residents as they prepare to celebrate Semana Santa (Holy Week), one of the most important holidays on the Spanish calendar.

#  Madrid Claims Second Biggest Payout in Blackjack History

Las Vegas – The city of Madrid announced yesterday that they had won a blackjack payout worth more than 2.7 billion euros, the second-largest in history.

The win comes after three weeks of play at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, during which time Madrid successfully wagered over 400 million euros.

A spokesman for the city confirmed that the money would be used to fund various public works projects, including a new metro line and several hospitals.

The largest blackjack payout in history was claimed by an anonymous player in 2014, who walked away with almost 3.4 billion euros.

#  Real Clinches Massive Payout in Blackjack Game vs. Monaco

On a recent evening, after a long day of work, I decided to take my mind off things and have some fun at the casino. I walked in and saw a blackjack table open with a modest bet limit. I thought to myself, this is perfect, as I don't feel like risking too much money tonight. So I sat down, and the dealer gave me my first cards. A three and a four. Not great, but not terrible either. I decided to hit, and got an ace. That put me at 17, so I decided to stay. The dealer turned over their next card- an eight- which meant they had 16. They then wanted to hit, and got another eight, for 24. Ouch.

At this point, most people would've just given up and gone home with nothing to show for their night. But not me- I was feeling lucky. I doubled down on my last two cards- a two and a six- which gave me 18 total. The dealer then turned over their last card- another two- meaning they has 20 total (the best possible hand you can get in blackjack is 21). This essentially meant that the chances of me winning were very slim. But miracles can happen in casinos, and against all odds, the dealer busted (went over 21). This gave me not only my original bet back, but also an extra few hundred dollars on top!

I was ecstatic! This was by far the biggest payout I'd ever gotten at a casino. It just goes to show that even when the odds seem stacked against you, sometimes lady luck can still smile down upon you. If you're ever feeling down or frustrated, I suggest you go to your nearest casino and try your luck at blackjack- who knows, you might just be the next one to walk away with a massive payday!
