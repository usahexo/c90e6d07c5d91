#  How do you play the Lord Fortune Hold and Win game? 

The Lord Fortune Hold and Win game is a casino game that can be played at many online casinos. The game is based on the traditional card game of Blackjack, but with an extra element of chance added in the form of a spinning wheel.

To play the Lord Fortune Hold and Win game, you first need to place your bet. You can then click on the Deal button to see two cards dealt to you. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by either getting as close to 21 as possible, or by having a higher total than the dealer.

In addition to your two cards, the dealer will also be shown two cards. One of these cards will be face up, while the other will be face down. If you think that the dealer's face-down card is a high value card (e.g. an ace), you can choose to 'hold' your hand by clicking on the Hold button. This will keep your cards locked in place and prevent you from taking any more cards.

If you don't want to hold your hand, you can click on the Draw button to take another card from the deck. You can keep drawing cards until you reach 21 or until you bust (i.e. go over 21). If the dealer has a better hand than you, then you'll lose your bet, but if your hand is better than the dealer's then you'll win!

The Lord Fortune Hold and Win game also features a spinning wheel which gives players an opportunity to win extra cash prizes in addition to their winning hand payout. The wheel has six different segments, each of which corresponds to a different prize amount. To spin the wheel, you simply need to click on it once it's stopped spinning.
