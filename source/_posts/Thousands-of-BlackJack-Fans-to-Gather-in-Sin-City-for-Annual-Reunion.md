#  First Time Ever: All 6 Living BlackJack Members to Perform Together

For the first time ever, all six living members of BlackJack will perform together. BlackJack is a Japanese rock band that was active from 1978 to 1992. The group has reunited several times over the years, but this will be their first performance with all six members in over two decades.

The reunion concert will be held at the Nippon Budokan on November 11th. The lineup will consist of vocalist Toshimitsu “Tommy” Deyu, guitarist Gota Yashiro, bassist Tetsuo Sakurai, drummer Eiji Shimizu, keyboardist Masaki Udagawa, and trumpeter Tetsuro Toyama.

BlackJack made their debut in 1978 with the album “BlackJack”. They achieved mainstream success in the early 80s with songs like “City Boy” and “Babe”. In 1992, they disbanded after releasing their tenth studio album “10 Years After”.

Since their breakup, BlackJack has reunited several times for one-off concerts. In 2006, they performed at the Heaven’s Rock festival in Saitama. In 2009, they played at the Tokyo Dome for two nights as part of Avex Trax’s 20th anniversary celebration. And in 2012, they headlined the Rising Sun Rock Festival in Ezo.

#  Huge Turnout Expected for Weekend of Events Celebrating the Band's Legacy

The city of Boise is gearing up for a weekend full of events to celebrate the legacy of the band Idaho. The popular local band recently announced their retirement after more than three decades of making music together.

City officials say that they are expecting a huge turnout for all of the events, which include a free concert in the park, a farmers market, and a parade. "This is going to be a historic event for Boise," said one city council member. "The band has been a part of this community for many years and their fans are sure to turn out in force."

Idaho formed in 1982 and quickly gained a following in the area with their unique style of bluegrass music.

Fans of the band are eagerly counting down the days until the final show and celebrating the band's legacy throughout Boise. "They're like family to us," said one fan. "We're so grateful for everything they've done for us over the years."
