#  Federal Gambling Crimes Investigations Unit formed

The Department of Justice has announced the formation of a new Federal Gambling Crimes Investigations Unit. The aim of the unit is to investigate illegal gambling activities, including those that involve organized crime. The new unit will be staffed by prosecutors and investigators from the DOJ’s Criminal Division and its Organized Crime and Gang Section.

This is good news for those who are concerned about the impact of illegal gambling on society. The formation of this new unit shows that the DOJ is taking this issue seriously and is committed to combating illegal gambling. This is important, because illegal gambling can have serious consequences for society as a whole, including things such as organized crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking.

The formation of this new unit also sends a message to those who are engaged in illegal gambling activities that they will be investigated and prosecuted. This should serve as a deterrent to those who might be thinking about engaging in such activities.

It will be interesting to see what kinds of cases the new unit prosecutes. Hopefully, it will help to reduce the amount of illegal gambling that takes place in our country.

#  Justice Department launches investigation into illegal gambling

The Department of Justice has announced that it is opening an investigation into illegal gambling.

It is not clear yet what specific types of gambling activities will be targeted by the DOJ, but officials say that they will be looking into all forms of illegal wagering.

"Illegal gambling is a serious crime that hurts innocent people and undermines our economy," said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. "We will not tolerate it."

The DOJ's crackdown on illegal gambling comes at a time when the industry is booming. Recent estimates suggest that illegal gambling is now a $150 billion business worldwide.

One of the main drivers of this growth is the rise of online betting, which allows people to place bets from anywhere in the world. This has created a black market for online gambling, which is now worth an estimated $24 billion.

The DOJ's investigation into illegal gambling will be headed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. He said that the department will be working closely with state and local law enforcement agencies to crack down on illegal gaming operations.

"We will use all of our tools to disrupt and dismantle these criminal enterprises," Rosenstein said.

#  FBI investigating large-scale gambling operations

The FBI is investigating a number of large-scale gambling operations around the United States. The investigations are said to be in early stages, but officials believe that the operations are linked.

One of the main focuses of the investigations is illegal sports betting. It is believed that millions of dollars are being gambled each day on sporting events, with much of the money coming from organized crime groups.

In addition to sports betting, the FBI is also looking into other types of gambling, including casino games and online poker. Officials believe that the gambling rings are operating out of several states, and that they have connections to organized crime groups in other parts of the world.

The FBI has declined to provide any further details about the investigations, but it is clear that they are taking them very seriously. In a statement, an official said that “gambling can have a serious impact on our economy and on our national security”.

This crackdown on gambling could lead to some major arrests in the coming months.

#  Federal task force formed to combat online gambling crimes

On Wednesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the formation of a new task force aimed at combating crime committed in connection with online gambling.

The new task force, dubbed the “Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force,” will bring together prosecutors from around the country who will focus on investigating and prosecuting crimes such as child exploitation, human trafficking, and illegal gambling.

According to Sessions, “The Department of Justice is committed to stopping criminals from exploiting vulnerabilities in technology to inflict harm on innocent people. The creation of this task force represents another step forward in our fight against criminal activity on the internet.”

In addition to combating online gambling-related crimes, the ICAC Task Force will also work to protect children from other online dangers, including sexual predators and cyberbullying.

#  More than $100 million seized in crackdown on gambling crimes

The Department of Justice announced a crackdown on illegal gambling, resulting in the seizure of more than $100 million.

"The Department of Justice is committed to rooting out illegal gambling and bringing those responsible to justice," said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. "This massive seizure shows that illegal gambling is not a victimless crime. It harms businesses, communities and families."

The investigation targeted two major criminal organizations that conducted illegal gambling nationwide. The first organization was involved in online sports betting, while the second operated an international casino that took bets on sporting events and other games.

"Illegal gambling is not a victimless crime," said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. "It can destroy lives by leading to addiction and financial ruin. This action demonstrates the Department's commitment to enforcing federal laws against illegal gambling and protecting the public."

More than $100 million was seized in bank accounts, luxury cars and other assets. Dozens of defendants were charged with offenses including money laundering, racketeering and fraud.
