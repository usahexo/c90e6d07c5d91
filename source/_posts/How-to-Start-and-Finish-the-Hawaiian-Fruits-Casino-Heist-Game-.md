#  How to Start and Finish the Hawaiian Fruits Casino Heist Game 

If you're looking for a new adventure to embark on, and want to try something different from the norm, then look no further than Hawaiian Fruits Casino Heist. This game is an online casino adventure that takes you through the process of robbing a casino. 

Although it may seem daunting at first, with a bit of practice and some helpful tips, you'll be well on your way to becoming a master thief. In this article, we'll give you a few pointers on how to start and finish the game with ease. 

To begin the game, you'll need to first create an account. Once you're logged in, click on "Play Now" and select the "Casino Heist" option. This will take you to the lobby where you can choose your preferred mode of play - solo or multiplayer. 

Once you've chosen your mode, you can then select your character and outfit. There are four characters to choose from: thief, hacker, bodyguard, and driver. Each character has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, so choose wisely! 

Next, it's time to choose your weapon. There are six weapons available: knife, silenced pistol, machine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Again, choose wisely depending on your playing style. 

Now that you're all set up, it's time to start the game! The objective is to rob the casino by stealing as much money as possible before getting caught by the police or security guards. There are three ways of stealing money: through looting cash registers, gambling (with a higher risk but higher rewards), or stealing chips from other players. 

Be careful though - if you get caught by security or police, they will arrest you and you will lose all of your money. The key is to be stealthy and stay out of sight! 

When you've completed the game - whether it's by completing the objectives or getting arrested - click on "End Game" in the lobby menu and enter your final score. Congratulations - you've just finished Hawaiian Fruits Casino Heist!

#  Complete the Hawaiian Fruits Casino Heist for Big Rewards 

The Hawaiian Fruits Casino Heist is a new event now available in Grand Theft Auto Online. Players are tasked with completing five different heists in order to earn big rewards. The first of these heists is the Casino Heist, which can be completed by gathering a team of three players and stealing $200,000 worth of cash from the casino.

The first step in the Casino Heist is to drive to the casino and find a way inside. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to use the backdoor near the pool. Once inside, make your way up to the cash room and steal the money. Be careful, as there are several security guards patrolling the casino.

Once you have the money, it's time to escape. There are several ways to do this, but my favorite is to use the helicopter on the rooftop. Fly to one of the nearby areas and drop off the money. Then fly back tothe casino and escape before getting caught.

If you're able to complete the Casino Heist, you'll earn a big reward of $200,000. Be sure to check out the other heists in this event for even bigger rewards!
